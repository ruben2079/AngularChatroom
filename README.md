# Chat

This is project based on angular with the following implementations:

- [x] Restful API manipulation
- [x] LocalStorage for online timer and username
- [x] Sass used for styling
- [x] Gulp as a task automation

The user is able to send messages in different chatrooms where the messages are kept even when the user changes rooms. A timer is in place just to give the user the idea for how long he/she has been active in the web app.

**Please take a look at an online project built from ground up using Angular and other technologies below:**

# Pryices - Online Project

This is a personal project I have worked on since most of the projects for I have done for companies are internal and are not available for the public. I have worked on a data driven web application compatible for different browsers, devices, and different operating systems **(Windows and Mac)**. 

It’s also based on responsive design (media queries) where users can interact with the web application through Restful APIs, designed and implemented by myself, using **MySQL** and **PHP**. It’s a single page app **(Angular 9)** which contains **cookies**, and **Google Analytics**.

The information input by every user can be created, updated, and deleted. In addition, the web application is built on other computer languages such as **HTML5 (including canvas for graphical presentation)**, **CSS3** (including animations), **Sass**, **Gulp**, **JavaScript(ES6+)**, and **Typescript**.

Finally, the web application has **encrypted** the credentials for every user in the database and the content can be displayed automatically in **English or Spanish**, depending on how the user has the settings for the browser.

Since, I like to grow on technologies I have an **Android SDK** application created by myself and available in **Google play**, using **Android Studio** in multiple languages.
